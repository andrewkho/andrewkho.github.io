I'm Andrew, I like doing fun stuff with computers like programming, machine learning, optimization, and deep learning.

The last time I updated this about page (Jan 2022), I was working at Uber as an Applied Scientist.
Previously I was a Data Scientist at Stitch Fix on both Recommendations and Operations Research.
I also interned for a year in 2006-2007 at a semiconductor company, Gennum Corp., working on Video Algorithms for the (at the time) brand new "HDTV" technology that was taking the world by storm.

Somewhere in the mix there I did my Master's and PhD, at two separate institutions just to extend the pain, working on surgical simulators and fluid simulations for swallowing.

My PhD advisor and notable Computer Scientist, [Sid Fels](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/ssfels/), used to tell me, "if the field has science in the name, it's probably not a real science," inspiring the name of this site.
