I'm Andrew, I like computers, machine learning, and optimization, not necessarily in that order.
The last time I updated this about page (Jan 2021), I was working at Uber as an Applied Scientist. Previously I was a Data Scientist at Stitch Fix on both Recommendations and Operations Research. I also interned for a year at a semiconductor company, Gennum Corp., working on Video Algorithms for the (at the time) brand new HDTV technology that was taking the world by storm.

Somewhere in the mix there I did my Master's and PhD, at two separate institutions just to extend the pain, working on surgical simulators and fluid simulations of swallowing.

[Sid Fels](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/ssfels/), my old PhD advisor and a notable Computer Scientist, used to tell me, "if the field has science in the name, it's probably not a real science," inspiring the name of this site.
